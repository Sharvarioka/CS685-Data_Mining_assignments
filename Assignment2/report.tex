\section{Analysis and conclusion}
{ The idea behind this report is to understand the way human beings link abstract ideas to the searches they do on a usual basis. We try to compare the paths taken by the humans and shortest paths obtained by the computer. 
\par The paths followed by the player suggests that initially there are jumps from one article to other which may not be directly related, but as the destination approaches, the jumps get smaller. The mined data suggests that most of the articles can be navigated from other article except very few which are either isolated articles (which do not have hyperlinks to other articles) or not related with large number of articles.
\par From the human path and the shortest path comparison, we can conclude that the human beings somehow intuitively manage to follow the path which is closely related or exact as the shortest path. This analysis can be used to predict the next best possible move for the user or what the user will/should take in order to reach the destination in the least number of clicks.In the end the neural network might require more data points than what we have provided in order to work efficiently.
